# Simulation-IoT-Network-Python

This project is a simulation of a time-varying IoT network with mobile and stable devices with different operation modes. The mobile devices change their position following a random walk algorithm. Every device is simulated as an object that includes all the necessary information such as the memory, the device's capabilities etc. Every device can communicate wirelessly with other devices within its transmission range. 

Furthermore, four communication methods are built in this simulation as well as two mechanisms to calculate the optimal MinCut and Maxflow for time-varying networks.  

This simulator can be used in order to be investigated efficient ways of communication of changeable environments of IoTs.
